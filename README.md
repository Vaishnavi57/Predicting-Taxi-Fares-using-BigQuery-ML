## Objective:
<p>Predict taxi fares in New York City using BigQuery ML.</p>

<p>Build a predictive model based on historical NYC taxi trip data.</p>

<p>Use key features like time of day, pickup and dropoff locations, and passenger count.<p>

<p>Improve fare prediction accuracy through data preprocessing and model tuning.<p>

<p>Provide a foundation for more complex systems such as dynamic pricing, route optimization, and real-time fare prediction for ride-hailing services.</p>
