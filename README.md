##Objective:
<h2>Predict taxi fares in New York City using BigQuery ML.</h2>

<h2>Build a predictive model based on historical NYC taxi trip data.</h2>

<h2>Use key features like time of day, pickup and dropoff locations, and passenger count.</h2>

<h2>Improve fare prediction accuracy through data preprocessing and model tuning.</h2>

<h2>Provide a foundation for more complex systems such as dynamic pricing, route optimization, and real-time fare prediction for ride-hailing services.</h2>
